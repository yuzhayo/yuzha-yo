# üéØ AI Agent Task: Expand Unified Layer System Detailed Implementation Plan

## üìã **Context & Background**
You are tasked to expand and create detailed implementation plan for a Unified Layer System that combines the best features from 3 existing systems: Launcher (Pixi.js 2D), Upgraded (Three.js 3D), and Variant (Pure TypeScript). 

I have already created initial analysis and simple plan. Your job is to **expand this into a comprehensive, actionable implementation plan**.

## üìÅ **Available Analysis Files (READ ALL):**
- `/app/old/launcher-file-relationships.md` - Launcher system architecture 
- `/app/old/launcher-stage-files-quick-reference.md` - Launcher file reference
- `/app/old/launcher-stage-transform-analysis.md` - Launcher technical analysis
- `/app/old/upgraded-file-relationships.md` - Upgraded system architecture
- `/app/old/upgraded-stages-files-quick-reference.md` - Upgraded file reference  
- `/app/old/upgraded-stages-system-analysis.md` - Upgraded technical analysis
- `/app/old/variant-file-relationships.md` - Variant system architecture
- `/app/old/variant-files-quick-reference.md` - Variant file reference
- `/app/old/variant-system-analysis.md` - Variant technical analysis
- `/app/old/unified-system-plan.md` ‚≠ê **PRIMARY FOCUS** - Base plan to expand
- `/app/old/unified-logic-analysis.md` - Logic consolidation analysis

## üéØ **Your Primary Task:**

**Expand `/app/old/unified-system-plan.md` into a comprehensive implementation roadmap with:**

### 1. **Detailed Implementation Specs** 
For each unified file (e.g., `LayerLogicBasic.ts`, `LayerCoreEngine.ts`):
- Exact function signatures and interfaces
- Integration points between systems  
- Code examples showing how to merge features
- Migration strategy from existing systems

### 2. **Android Optimization Details**
- Specific performance optimizations for Android WebView
- Device detection algorithms  
- Quality scaling strategies
- Memory management techniques

### 3. **Week-by-Week Implementation Plan**
Expand the 6-week timeline with:
- Daily tasks breakdown
- Dependencies between tasks
- Testing milestones
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 4. **Technical Architecture Deep Dive**
- Detailed file structure with exact exports/imports
- Configuration schema design
- Error handling strategies
- Performance monitoring implementation

### 5. **Integration Patterns**
- How React components interact with unified engine
- Configuration management flow
- Event handling architecture
- Renderer abstraction layer

## üìê **Key Design Principles (MUST FOLLOW):**
- ‚úÖ **Single rendering engine** (Three.js only)
- ‚úÖ **Percentage-based positioning** (from Launcher)  
- ‚úÖ **Pure functional logic** (from Variant)
- ‚úÖ **Modular architecture** (from Upgraded)
- ‚úÖ **Android WebView optimization** (primary target)
- ‚úÖ **File naming pattern**: `LayerCore*`, `LayerLogic*`, `LayerReact*`

## üéØ **Specific Deliverables Required:**

1. **Expanded Implementation Plan** - update/enhance `unified-system-plan.md`
2. **Detailed Technical Specifications** - for each unified module
3. **Migration Guide** - step-by-step from each existing system
4. **Testing Strategy** - unit, integration, performance testing
5. **Android Performance Guide** - device-specific optimizations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- Base your work on the existing analysis files
- Don't reinvent - combine and enhance what already works
- Focus on practical, actionable implementation steps
- Consider Android WebView performance as TOP priority
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Provide concrete code examples and interfaces

## üöÄ **Expected Output Format:**
Create detailed sections for:
- [ ] Technical Architecture Specification
- [ ] Implementation Timeline (6 weeks detailed)
- [ ] Module-by-Module Implementation Guide
- [ ] Android Optimization Strategy
- [ ] Testing & Quality Assurance Plan
- [ ] Migration & Integration Guide

**Start by reading all the provided analysis files, then expand the unified-system-plan.md with comprehensive implementation details.**
