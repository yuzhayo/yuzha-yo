Current State:
Text Alignment exists: Left/Center/Right buttons in settings (lines 136-153)

This only aligns text WITHIN the floating box
Does NOT move the position of the floating element
Position is stored in OverlaySettings.position as {x, y} relative coordinates

Users can manually drag to reposition
Position is saved/loaded with presets
What You Want:
Position Alignment Buttons - to snap floating elements to viewport positions like:

Horizontal: Left, Center, Right (of viewport)
Vertical: Top, Middle, Bottom (of viewport)
Proposed Solution:
Add Position Alignment Controls in each overlay section (Time/Date/Location):

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Time Settings               │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ [Text alignment: L|C|R]     │  ← Existing (text align)
│                             │
│ Position in Viewport:       │  ← NEW
│ [Left] [Center] [Right]     │  ← Horizontal alignment
│ [Top]  [Middle] [Bottom]    │  ← Vertical alignment
└─────────────────────────────┘
Behavior:

Click "Center" → Element moves to horizontal center of viewport
Click "Bottom" → Element moves to bottom of viewport
Can combine: "Right + Top" = top-right corner
After alignment, users can still drag manually
Works with boundary constraints (stays within viewport)

this is much better! Reuse the existing Align buttons for DUAL purpose:

How It Would Work:
When clicking "Left":

✅ Text aligns left within the box (current behavior)
✅ + Element moves to left side of viewport (new behavior)
When clicking "Center":

✅ Text aligns center within the box
✅ + Element moves to horizontal center of viewport
When clicking "Right":

✅ Text aligns right within the box
✅ + Element moves to right side of viewport
Benefits:
🎯 Simpler UI - no extra buttons
🎯 Intuitive - "Center" means center everything
🎯 Consistent - text and position match
Implementation:
onClick="Left" → 
  1. textAlign = "left"
  2. position.x = 20 (left margin)

onClick="Center" → 
  1. textAlign = "center"
  2. position.x = (viewport.width - elementWidth) / 2

onClick="Right" → 
  1. textAlign = "right"  
  2. position.x = viewport.width - elementWidth - 20
