Decided on image mapping understanding
I'll help you understand the image mapping concept first, then we can fix the issues properly.


Searched for "What is the purpose of imageMapping with imageTip, imageBase, and imageCenter? How are they supposed to be used in the rendering or animation system?"

Decided on unused variable findings (4 seconds)
Image Mapping Concept Analysis
Based on my deep analysis, here's what I found:

Current System (What the code does):
Config has imageTip - This is an angle in degrees (e.g., 90¬∞ = top)

Code calculates 3 points:

imageCenter - geometric center of the image
imageTip - point on the edge at the specified angle
imageBase - point on the opposite edge (180¬∞ from tip)
BUT HERE'S THE KEY FINDING:

‚úÖ imageCenter is actively used (as default spin center)
‚ùå imageTip point is calculated but NEVER used
‚ùå imageBase point is calculated but NEVER used
The Truth (confirmed by grep):
Only one reference to imageTip exists:
Line 130: const tipAngle = typeof entry.imageTip === "number" ? entry.imageTip : 90;
         (This reads the ANGLE, not the calculated point)
Zero references to .imageTip or .imageBase anywhere in rendering code.
What Should Happen:
The intended concept seems to be:

Images like clock hands or arrows have a "tip" (front) and "base" (back)
These reference points could be used for:
Aligning multiple images (e.g., clock hand tip to center)
Attaching objects to specific points
Advanced animations
But none of this is implemented. The calculation exists but is dead code.

My Recommendation:
Option 1: Remove Dead Code (Simple)

Remove imageTip and imageBase from ImageMapping
Remove the calculation logic
Keep only imageCenter and imageDimensions
Remove imageTip from config (it's not doing anything useful)
Option 2: Implement Properly (If you have a use case)

Keep the concept but actually use the points
For example: Allow setting spin center as "tip" or "base" instead of percentages
Which direction do you want to go? Do you have a specific use case for tip/base, or should we clean up the dead code?

1 minute of work
correct logic is use imagemapping to calculate image dimension convert it to 0-100h 0-100w then determine imagecenter, 50.50,
then imagetip is draw imaginaginary line from imagecenter to up 90degree (default)
and image base is 180degree (default)
do you understand until here, i will continue after your confirm

Decided on percentage-based mapping (6 seconds)
Yes, I understand! Let me confirm:

Your Correct Logic:

Image dimensions ‚Üí Normalize to 0-100% coordinate system

Width: 0-100%
Height: 0-100%
Image center = 50%, 50% (always in the middle)

Image tip = Imaginary line from center pointing at 90¬∞ (up) by default

This is a DIRECTION, not a specific edge point
Image base = Imaginary line from center pointing at 180¬∞ opposite (down) by default

Also a DIRECTION
So the system should use percentage-based coordinates where:

Center is always at (50, 50)
Tip and Base are ANGLES/DIRECTIONS from center, not edge coordinates
This is different from current code which calculates pixel coordinates at the edge!

I understand. Please continue explaining how this should be used! üëç
